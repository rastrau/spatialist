    "text": "A new (currently, beta) service from Stephan Heuel, https://topoprint.ch offers an innovative way to interact with Switzerland’s topography. By combining high-resolution Swisstopo datasets with 3D printing technology, users can create detailed, tangible models – Topodiscs – of any location in Switzerland.\nTopodiscs are compact, 3D-printable models that represent terrain, buildings, and infrastructure within a defined radius. Users can choose locations by address or CH1903+ LV95 / EPSG:2056 coordinates through either Mastodon or Telegram and receive an STL file for 3D printing (adding a 3D-print-on-demand service is on the roadmap).\n\n\n\nA Topodisc of the area around the Federal Palace of Switzerland"

The data amounts to 70,409,082,675,345 LiDAR points at the time of writing.\n\n\n\nA LiDAR view of Boston\n\n\nThe datasets cover most of the USA and can be looked at in the browser using Potree-based or Cesium-based viewers. The data has been processed into the Entwine Point Tile format which combines JSON for metadata and LAZ for data for performance."

We’ll see how this will develop, and into what.\nIt’s not meant as a mid-2000s to early 2010s-style full-fledged blog with longform articles, commentary and opinion, but rather as a microblogging-style news curation service that is entirely indepedent of social platforms and entirely dependent on my interests and capacity to publish.\nTo who does ‘I’ refer, above? For now, this is run by Ralph.\nReach out with questions, feedback, ideas or if you’d like to contribute."

In the domain of small satellites, ONGLAISAT of the Tokyo-based company ArkEdge Space developed in collaboration with the Taiwan Space Agency TASA has achieved a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 meters from a relatively low orbit of 410 kilometers.\nFrom the press release:\nWhile the sample image displayed here may also show some of the current limitations of TDI, it’s nevertheless an exciting development to potentially have this spatial resolution available from small space-borne platforms."

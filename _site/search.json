Well, GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY are now native logical data types in both Apache Parquet1 and Apache Iceberg2, just like, e.g., INT32 is. This is a big step for mainstreaming “geo” in the cloud-native3 data community.\nWhat’s going to be even more interesting are the next steps in order to make the cloud-native paradigm work better for spatial data. The rough roadmap and more details are available from CNG."

This event celebrates innovative and outstanding cartographic products with a connection to Switzerland. The award highlights excellence in cartography, geomatics, and geovisualization, offering recognition across multiple categories.\nBesides its main category, the Prix Carto also includes two special awards to foster young talent: the “Prix Carto – start”, aimed at school students and apprentices, and the “Prix Carto – edu”, designed for university students and adults in training programs. Both of the “young talent” awards carry a prize of 500 Swiss Francs.\nSubmissions for the 2025 awards are now open, with participants required to submit their entries through an official form on the SGK website. The SGK encourages widespread participation from both seasoned professionals and emerging talents."

But: By now, a cultural history of the Shapefile, the world’s foremost geospatial data format1 since the early 1990s (!), would be warranted, such is its impact. James Fee’s article “Shapefile: The Persistent Legacy of a GIS Workhorse” makes the point:\nLuckily, I don’t usually have to cater to workflows that rely on Shapefiles at all2.\nAs to alternatives, there are many to chose from. I find it hard to name “the best” data format, since it very much depends:\nI do find GeoParquet and FlatGeoBuf particulary interesting vector data formats, for some of my use cases – ymmv3, obviously."

    "text": "Quite a mouthful, that title: “Road network disruptions during extreme flooding events and their impact on the access to emergency medical services: A spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis”. From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

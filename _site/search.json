    "text": "The commodification of high-resolution optical satellite imagery continues. In the domain of small satellites, ONGLAISAT of the Tokyo-based company ArkEdge Space developed in collaboration with the Taiwan Space Agency TASA has achieved a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 meters from a relatively low orbit of 410 kilometers.\nFrom the press release:\nWhile the sample image displayed here may also show some of the current limitations of TDI, it’s nevertheless an exciting development to potentially have this spatial resolution available from small space-borne platforms."

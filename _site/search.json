    "text": "Quite a mouthful, that title: “Road network disruptions during extreme flooding events and their impact on the access to emergency medical services: A spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis”. From a Swiss-Austrian team comes this interesting analysis of how disruptions in the road network of the canton of Berne that are induced by extreme flooding events affect the population’s access to emergency medical services (EMS). The paper is open-access.\nIt seems, event-specific EMS accessibility is an under-studied topic, but certainly relevant with extreme rain and flooding events on the increase due to climate change. The researchers studied accessibility and changes in accessibility in 1 km spatial and 1 hour temporal resolution through a simulated flooding event over six days, among other things.\nFrom the paper:\n\nIn the context of flood disasters, further investigation into complex and cascading impacts would be advantageous for more informed and effective management of dynamic flood risk. (…) existing infrastructure was designed before increasingly more extreme events due to climate change have been and expect to continue occurring. Preparing for rare but high consequence flood events is a core part of undertaking anticipatory actions by emergency managers, rather than acting only after the onset of a flood event. Such preparations involve custom measures that incorporate local context to reduce societal vulnerabilities."

By combining high-resolution Swisstopo datasets with 3D printing technology, users can create detailed, tangible models – Topodiscs – of any location in Switzerland.\nTopodiscs are compact, 3D-printable models that represent terrain, buildings, and infrastructure within a defined radius. Users can choose locations by address or CH1903+ LV95 / EPSG:2056 coordinates through either Mastodon or Telegram and receive an STL file for 3D printing (adding a 3D-print-on-demand service is on the roadmap).\n\n\n\nA Topodisc of the area around the Federal Palace of Switzerland"

This event celebrates innovative and outstanding cartographic products with a connection to Switzerland. The award highlights excellence in cartography, geomatics, and geovisualization, offering recognition across multiple categories.\nBesides its main category, the Prix Carto also includes two special awards to foster young talent: the “Prix Carto – start”, aimed at school students and apprentices, and the “Prix Carto – edu”, designed for university students and adults in training programs. Both of the “young talent” awards carry a prize of 500 Swiss Francs.\nSubmissions for the 2025 awards are now open, with participants required to submit their entries through an official form on the SGK website. The SGK encourages widespread participation from both seasoned professionals and emerging talents."

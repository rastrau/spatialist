    "text": "A new (currently, beta) service from Stephan Heuel, https://topoprint.ch offers an innovative way to interact with Switzerland’s topography. By combining high-resolution Swisstopo datasets with 3D printing technology, users can create detailed, tangible models – Topodiscs – of any location in Switzerland.\nTopodiscs are compact, 3D-printable models that represent terrain, buildings, and infrastructure within a defined radius. Users can choose locations by address or CH1903+ LV95 / EPSG:2056 coordinates through either Mastodon or Telegram and receive an STL file for 3D printing (adding a 3D-print-on-demand service is on the roadmap).\n\n\n\nA Topodisc of the area around the Federal Palace of Switzerland"

We’ll see how this will develop, and into what.\nIt’s not meant as a mid-2000s to early 2010s-style full-fledged blog with longform articles, commentary and opinion, but rather as a microblogging-style news curation service that is entirely indepedent of social platforms and entirely dependent on my interests and capacity to publish.\nTo who does ‘I’ refer, above? For now, this is run by Ralph.\nReach out with questions, feedback, ideas or if you’d like to contribute."

    "text": "The Swiss Society of Cartography (Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Kartografie, SGK) is set to host the prestigious bi-annual Prix Carto awards during its autumn meeting in 2025. This event celebrates innovative and outstanding cartographic products with a connection to Switzerland. The award highlights excellence in cartography, geomatics, and geovisualization, offering recognition across multiple categories.\nBesides its main category, the Prix Carto also includes two special awards to foster young talent: the “Prix Carto – start”, aimed at school students and apprentices, and the “Prix Carto – edu”, designed for university students and adults in training programs. Both of the “young talent” awards carry a prize of 500 Swiss Francs.\nSubmissions for the 2025 awards are now open, with participants required to submit their entries through an official form on the SGK website. The SGK encourages widespread participation from both seasoned professionals and emerging talents."

    "text": "The commodification of high-resolution optical satellite imagery continues. In the domain of small satellites, ONGLAISAT of the Tokyo-based company ArkEdge Space developed in collaboration with the Taiwan Space Agency TASA has achieved a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5 meters from a relatively low orbit of 410 kilometers.\nFrom the press release:\nWhile the sample image displayed here may also show some of the current limitations of TDI, it’s nevertheless an exciting development to potentially have this spatial resolution available from small space-borne platforms."

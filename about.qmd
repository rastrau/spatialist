On this site, I aim to share interesting (to me) news in the geospatial domain. 
No guarantees regarding anything â€“ frequency, quality or that it even stays 
around. We'll see how this will develop, and into what. 

It's not meant as a mid-2000s to early 2010s-style full-fledged *blog* with 
longform articles, commentary and opinion, but rather as a microblogging-style 
news curation service that is entirely indepedent of social platforms and 
entirely dependent on my interests and capacity to publish. 

To who does 'my' refer, above? For now, this is run by 
[Ralph](https://ralphstraumann.ch). 

[Reach out](mail@ralphstraumann.ch) with questions, feedback, ideas or if you'd 
like to contribute.
